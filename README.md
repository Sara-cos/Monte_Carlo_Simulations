# Random Sampling to Estimate Pi Value
This code uses random sampling to estimate the value of pi. The program generates random points inside a square and checks if they lie inside a circle with the same radius as the side of the square. By calculating the ratio of the number of points inside the circle to the total number of points generated, the program approximates the value of pi.
